 # ðŸ”€ Bedrock Tunnel Endpoint
 Spin up your own custom OpenAI API server endpoint for easy AWS Bedrock LLM text inference (using standard `baseUrl`, and `apiKey` params)

 ---

### Why Bedrock Tunnel Endpoint?

Are you are stuck with using AWS Bedrock for all LLM text inference, but you want to keep your application platform agnostic?  Are you tired of figuring out how to format your LLM inference calls to work with the Bedrock SDK? Are you going crazy with all the differences between configuration from model to model?

- `Bedrock Tunnel Endpoint` makes it easy to continue using the OpenAI API client that you are use to by standing up your own OpenAI text compatible endpoint that will proxy all your calls to Bedrock in a compatible way.

- Great for getting existing OpenAI API compatible applications working with AWS Bedrock.

### Configuration

* Update the `.env` file in the root directory of the project with the following
  environment variables based on your desired configuration:

    | key             | value type | example           | notes                       |
    |-----------------|------------|-------------------|-----------------------------|
    | CONSOLE_LOGGING | boolean    | false             | show realtime logs          |
    | HTTP_ENABLED    | boolean    | true              | start s HTTP server         |
    | HTTP_PORT       | integer    | 80                | HTTP server port            |
    | HTTPS_ENABLED   | boolean    | false             | start a HTTPS server        |
    | HTTPS_PORT      | integer    | 443               | HTTPS server port           |
    | HTTPS_KEY_PATH  | string     | ./path/mykey.key  | path to key file for HTTPS  |
    | HTTPS_CERT_PATH | string     | ./path/mycert.pem | path to cert file for HTTPS |

### Authentication

`Bedrock Tunnel` authenticates with AWS via `IAM`. Since the OpenAI API intance accpets an API Key we will utilize this value to hold your credentials. Construct your `apiKey` for inference in the next step following this format:

- `AWS_REGION` + `.` + `AWS_ACCESS_KEY_ID` + `.` + `AWS_SECRET_ACCESS_KEY`
- example `apiKey` value:  
  `us-west-2.AKIAWSGBPOAB34JZUEPP.ySssDeZBXGab+eqeaAxblSL+iEc/CS8Ff1HW3VV7`

---

### Usage

- Start the server via: `node server`  
  You are now ready to make a standard chat completions to the server.

- Important values
  - `baseUrl`: Root address of server based on your `.env` configuration.
  - `apiKey`: Descibed in the *Authentication* section above.
  - `messages`: Array of objects in role / content format.
  - `model`: This can be either the `modelName` or `modelId` from the list of supported models found on the `Bedrock Tunnel` README file [here](https://github.com/jparkerweb/bedrock-tunnel?tab=readme-ov-file#supported-models); The `/models` enpoint of this server will also return a list of supported models.

### Example OpenAI API Call

```javascript
import OpenAI from 'openai';

const messages = [
    {
        role: "system",
        content: "You are a helpful AI assistant that follows instructions extremely well. Answer the user questions accurately.",
    },
    {
        role: "user",
        content: "Describe why the OpenAI API standard is so great. Limit your response to five sentences.",
    },
    {
        role: "assistant",
        content: "",
    },
];

const baseURL = "http://localhost";
const apiKey = "us-west-2.AKIAWSGBPOAB34JZUEPP.ySssDeZBXGab+eqeaAxblSL+iEc/CS8Ff1HW3VV7"

const openai = new OpenAI({
    baseURL: baseURL,
    apiKey: apiKey,
});
const chatCompletion = await openai.chat.completions.create({
    messages: messages,
    model: "Llama-3-70b",
    max_tokens: 800,
    temperature: 0.4,
    top_p: 0.7,
    stream: true,
})

for await (const chunk of chatCompletion) {
    const response = chunk.choices[0]?.delta?.content || "";
    process.stdout.write(response);
}
```
